# What is TotemFI?

TotemFI is a community-driven Decentralised Finance (DeFI) platform which provides access to prediction markets using blockchain technology to solve issues with traditional markets. This innovative, minimal-risk prediction protocol rewards individuals and groups of users for accurately predicting the price of a given asset or outcome of an event.
